<h1 align="center" id="title">Heart Disease Prediction System</h1>

## Overview

Welcome to the Heart Disease Prediction System project! This project aims to develop an intelligent system that predicts the likelihood of a person having a particular heart disease based on various health-related features. The system utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze historical health data, contributing to early disease detection and proactive healthcare management.

## Project Objectives

1. *Data Collection:*
   - Gather a diverse dataset containing relevant health features, including but not limited to age, gender, BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and family medical history.

2. *Data Preprocessing:*
   - Perform thorough data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data quality.
   - Normalize or standardize features to bring them to a consistent scale.

3. *Feature Selection:*
   - Employ feature selection techniques to identify the most influential variables for disease prediction.
   - Ensure that selected features contribute significantly to the accuracy of the machine learning models.

## Intern Project Phase - 2

4. *Model Development:*
   - Explore and implement various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines for disease prediction.
   - Evaluate and compare the performance of different models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. *Cross-Validation:*
   - Implement cross-validation techniques to assess the generalization performance of the models and mitigate overfitting.

6. *Hyperparameter Tuning:*
   - Fine-tune the hyperparameters of selected machine learning models to optimize their performance.

7. *Validation and Testing:*
   - Conduct extensive testing and validation to ensure the accuracy, reliability, and robustness of the disease prediction system.
